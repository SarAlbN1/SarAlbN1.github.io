                        I had so much anxiety about the entire process and heard horror stories from friends about the
                        entire closing
                        process. Not for us!

                        We worked with April Williams and she was such a delight from beginning to
                        end. We feel so lucky we got to go through this process with her.</p>

                        it a home. The same highremarks go for the JLG.

                        Everyone that we have interacted with was polite, timely, and transparent. We are first-time
                        home buyers so
                        we truly appreciate all of the work that you folks have done for us. We’ll be sure to send
                        people your way -
                        keep up the great work."</p>

                        patience and grace!  We found a great house in a great location, exactly what we were looking for; the perfect place. She cared about my wants, needs, and overall safety. I will definitely buy
                        another home with the Justin Landis Group the entire staff is amazing!!</p>

                        looking and what we were looking for. Personable, reliable, and professional. Will recommend her
                        to anyone looking for a place. Can't thank her enough she did an excellent job!</p>
